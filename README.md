<h2 align="center"> Toy App on Rails üõ§Ô∏è</h2>

This sample micropost project was made using Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). My personal goal using this is to review and solidify the fundamentals with Ruby on Rails.

Users can create a basic account with their name and email, as well as edit, and delete their user info. Users can also write microposts, similar to a tweet. 
My end result toy_app is deployed [HERE!](https://agile-gorge-31668.herokuapp.com/) <br>As this is a basic app, you will need to manually enter the path of the microposts URL into the browser bar to make a post, or click [HERE :)](https://agile-gorge-31668.herokuapp.com/microposts)
